# Unofficial FullTime API

**Disclaimer: This is an unofficial API and is not endorsed or supported by The Football Association (The FA).**

FullTime API is an open source RESTful API that retrieves football data from [FullTime](https://fulltime.thefa.com/). It scrapes the FullTime website provided by The FA to provide structured, JSON-formatted data for fixtures, match results, league tables, and player statistics.

Example of a BETA verison of this API is in use at: [Axbridge United](https://utb2.netlify.app/league)

## Features

- **Fixtures**: Retrieve upcoming fixtures for various leagues.
- **Results**: Access match results from completed fixtures.
- **League Tables**: Get up-to-date league standings.
- **Player Stats**: View detailed statistics for players, including games played, goals scored, and cards received.
